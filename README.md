Boids Simulation in JavaScript
A JavaScript implementation of the Boids Flocking Algorithm. Boids is a well-known artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking (or swarming) behavior of birds, fish, or other similar group dynamics.

Separation – Boids avoid colliding with each other.
Alignment – Boids try to match the heading and speed of their neighbors.
Cohesion – Boids move towards the center of their local flockmates.
You can run this simulation in your web browser and tweak the parameters to experiment with different flocking behaviors.

Features
Interactive Visualization – Real-time graphics rendered on an HTML canvas.
Configurable Parameters – Change rules’ weights, perception radius, maximum speed, and more.
Pause/Resume & Reset – Easily pause or reset the simulation and try different values.
Simple Setup – No complex build steps are necessary; just open the HTML page in a browser.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
(Optional) A local web server if you want to serve the page instead of using file:// URLs, but it’s not strictly required.
Installation
Clone or download this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-boids-simulation.git
Or simply download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it locally.

Open the project folder:

bash
Copy
cd js-boids-simulation
Open the index.html file in your browser:

Double-click the index.html file in your file explorer, or
Serve the directory with a local server (optional). For example:
bash
Copy
npx http-server .
and then visit http://localhost:8080 (depending on the port).
Usage
Run the simulation: Open index.html in your browser.

Customization
You can fine-tune the simulation by modifying or exposing parameters:

Separation distance: The distance below which boids will repel each other.
Alignment strength: The force that compels boids to align their velocity with neighbors.
Cohesion force: The force that pulls boids toward the centroid of neighbors.
Perception radius: Defines how far a boid “sees” neighbors for the rules to apply.
Max speed / acceleration: Prevent boids from moving or turning too fast.
These parameters can be hard-coded in the JavaScript files or exposed in UI controls for real-time adjustments.
