# Boids Simulation

This project is a **Boids Simulation** implemented in JavaScript. It simulates flocking behavior, where multiple agents ("boids") move based on simple rules to create lifelike swarm motion.

## Features
- **Cohesion**: Boids move toward the center of mass of their neighbors.
- **Separation**: Boids avoid colliding with nearby boids.
- **Alignment**: Boids match the velocity of their neighbors.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Boids navigate around obstacles.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- CSS for styling

## Installation
To run the simulation locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/boids-simulation.git
   cd boids-simulation
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
- Open the **simulation** in your browser.
- Observe how the boids move based on the flocking algorithm.

## Example Output
The simulation will display a group of boids moving fluidly according to the flocking rules, creating a natural swarm behavior.
